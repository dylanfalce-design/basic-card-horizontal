## Dylan's Business Card

This is my first project in a graphic design and web type class. I needed to create a personal buisness card showing off graphic desigh as well as coding skills. I lered the basics of coding in CSS as well as HTML and worked on my own to experiment and design my card. First I sketched out on paper my ideas before translating them to illustrator. I then took time to format and layout my card keeping in mind font and space which I struggled with at first but soon got the hang of. I always enjoys the outdoors as well as my time out in Arizona inspiring me for my design and sunset look of the background. Over all I am happy how it turned out and excited to see what I can do in the future.
